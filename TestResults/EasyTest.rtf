\f0\fs24 \cf0 This package would allow for parallel coordinate plots, scatterplot matrices, and replicate line plots to be useful for large multivariate datasets by using interactivity, linking, and summarizations. Such plots would be useful for RNA-sequencing data, factor analysis, principal component analysis, and discriminant analysis. Once the new plotting methods have been testing on various large multivariate datasets, they will be combined into an R package called bigPint to benefit the R community.}
